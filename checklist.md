   - [ ] Cave generation

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Frustum culling
   - [ ] Mesh instancing
   - [ ] Web Workers for terrain generation
   - [ ] GPU acceleration

3. **Rendering Enhancements**
   - [ ] Shadows
   - [ ] Water rendering with reflections
   - [ ] Fog and atmospheric effects
   - [ ] Day/night cycle

4. **Interaction System**
   - [ ] First-person controls
   - [ ] Voxel editing (add/remove blocks)
   - [ ] Collision detection
   - [ ] Physics integration

5. **World Management**
   - [ ] Infinite terrain generation
   - [ ] World saving/loading
   - [ ] Seed-based world generation

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Three.js scene with camera, renderer, and lighting
2. Implement Simplex noise with configurable parameters
3. Create chunk generation system with size parameters
4. Develop material system with height-based texture mapping
5. Optimize rendering using instanced meshes
6. Add frustum culling to skip off-screen chunks
7. Implement LOD system for distant terrain
8. Add biome system using temperature and humidity noise
9. Create first-person camera controls
10. Implement voxel editing functionality
11. Add collision detection and physics
12. Develop saving/loading system using IndexedDB
13. Create UI controls for world parameters

## Testing Procedures
