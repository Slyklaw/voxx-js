# Ambient Occlusion Optimization

## Problem
Previously, AO calculations were being performed for every chunk immediately when it was loaded, even when neighboring chunks weren't available yet. This caused:

1. **Redundant calculations**: Chunks would calculate AO with incomplete neighbor data, then recalculate when neighbors loaded
2. **Performance waste**: AO calculations are expensive and were happening too frequently
3. **Visual inconsistency**: Chunks at boundaries would have incorrect AO until neighbors loaded

## Solution
Implemented a neighbor-aware AO calculation system that only performs AO when all 4 direct neighbors (North, South, East, West) are loaded and generated.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Chunk State Tracking
- Added `isGenerated` flag to track when terrain generation is complete
- Added `hasMesh` flag to track mesh creation state
- Added `areNeighborsReady()` method to check if all 4 neighbors are available

#### 2. Conditional AO Calculation
- Modified `createMesh()` to accept a `forceAO` parameter
- AO is only calculated when `areNeighborsReady()` returns true OR `forceAO` is true
- Chunks without neighbors get basic lighting instead of incorrect AO

#### 3. Progressive Mesh Upgrading
- Chunks initially create meshes without AO (fast)
- When neighbors become available, chunks upgrade to AO-enabled meshes
- Old meshes are properly disposed to prevent memory leaks

#### 4. Statistics Tracking
- Added `aoStats` to track optimization effectiveness:
  - `chunksWithAO`: Chunks created with proper AO
  - `chunksWithoutAO`: Chunks created with basic lighting
  - `chunksUpgraded`: Chunks that were upgraded from basic to AO
  - `aoPercentage`: Percentage of chunks with AO

### Implementation Details

#### Neighbor Detection
```javascript
areNeighborsReady() {
  const neighbors = [
    [this.chunkX - 1, this.chunkZ], // West
    [this.chunkX + 1, this.chunkZ], // East
    [this.chunkX, this.chunkZ - 1], // North
    [this.chunkX, this.chunkZ + 1]  // South
  ];
  
  for (const [x, z] of neighbors) {
    const key = `${x},${z}`;
    const neighbor = this.world.chunks[key];
    
    if (!neighbor || !neighbor.isGenerated || this.world.pendingChunks.has(key)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

#### Mesh Creation Flow
1. Chunk terrain is generated (worker thread)
2. `createChunkMeshIfReady()` is called
3. If neighbors are ready: create mesh with AO
4. If neighbors not ready: create mesh with basic lighting
5. When new chunks load, `checkNeighborsForAO()` upgrades existing chunks

#### Upgrade Process
```javascript
checkNeighborsForAO(chunkX, chunkZ) {
  // Check all 4 direct neighbors
  for (const [x, z] of neighbors) {
    const neighbor = this.chunks[`${x},${z}`];
    
    if (neighbor && neighbor.isGenerated && neighbor.areNeighborsReady()) {
      // Remove old mesh
      this.scene.remove(neighbor.mesh);
      neighbor.mesh.geometry.dispose();
      neighbor.mesh.material.dispose();
      neighbor.hasMesh = false;
      
      // Create new mesh with AO
      this.createChunkMeshIfReady(neighbor);
      this.aoStats.chunksUpgraded++;
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced AO calculations**: Only calculate when all data is available
- **No redundant work**: Chunks don't recalculate AO multiple times
- **Faster initial loading**: Basic meshes render immediately

### Visual Quality
- **Consistent AO**: All AO calculations use complete neighbor data
- **No boundary artifacts**: Eliminates incorrect AO at chunk edges
- **Progressive enhancement**: Terrain appears quickly, then improves with AO

### Monitoring
- **Real-time statistics**: UI shows AO optimization effectiveness
- **Debug logging**: Console shows chunk creation and upgrade events
- **Performance metrics**: Track AO coverage percentage

## Usage

The optimization is automatic and requires no user intervention. Monitor effectiveness through:

1. **UI Statistics**: Watch "AO Optimization" section in the game UI
2. **Console Logs**: Check browser console for chunk creation messages
3. **Visual Inspection**: Notice terrain loads quickly, then gets enhanced lighting

## Testing

Run the test script to verify neighbor detection logic:
```bash
node test_ao_optimization.js
```

Or test live in the browser console while the application is running.

## Future Improvements

1. **Diagonal neighbors**: Consider diagonal chunks for even better AO quality
2. **Partial AO**: Calculate AO for faces that have complete neighbor data
3. **Priority queuing**: Prioritize AO upgrades for chunks near the player
4. **Caching**: Cache AO calculations for reuse when chunks are reloaded
