# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds essential debugging and information UI elements to the Minecraft clone game. The UI will display real-time performance metrics and player position information to help with development, debugging, and gameplay awareness. These elements will be non-intrusive overlay components that provide valuable feedback without interfering with the core game experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the current FPS (frames per second) displayed on screen, so that I can monitor game performance in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL display the current FPS in the top-left corner of the screen
2. WHEN the FPS changes THEN the system SHALL update the displayed value in real-time
3. WHEN the FPS drops below 30 THEN the system SHALL display the FPS counter in red color to indicate performance issues
4. WHEN the FPS is above 30 THEN the system SHALL display the FPS counter in green color to indicate good performance
5. IF the game is paused THEN the system SHALL continue to display the last known FPS value

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer and player, I want to see my current camera/player position coordinates displayed on screen, so that I can understand my location in the world for debugging and navigation purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL display the current X, Y, Z coordinates in the top-right corner of the screen
2. WHEN the player moves THEN the system SHALL update the coordinate display in real-time
3. WHEN displaying coordinates THEN the system SHALL format them to 2 decimal places for readability
4. WHEN displaying coordinates THEN the system SHALL label them clearly as "X: [value], Y: [value], Z: [value]"
5. IF the camera position is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display "Position: Loading..." as a fallback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI elements to be visually clear and non-intrusive, so that they provide useful information without blocking important game content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL use a semi-transparent dark background for better text readability
2. WHEN UI elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL use white text with appropriate font size for visibility
3. WHEN UI elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL position them in screen corners to avoid blocking central game view
4. WHEN the game window is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain proper positioning of UI elements
5. IF the UI elements overlap with game content THEN the system SHALL ensure UI elements remain on top with proper z-index
