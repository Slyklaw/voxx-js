# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing voxx-js voxel terrain engine into a comprehensive game engine suitable for building voxel-based games. The current engine provides solid terrain generation and rendering foundations with efficient chunk-based world management (32x256x32 chunks), greedy meshing optimization, and multi-threaded terrain generation using web workers. The engine currently supports 6 block types (air, stone, dirt, grass, water, snow) with vertex coloring and includes basic first-person controls with pointer lock. However, it lacks essential game development features like entity systems, physics, audio, UI frameworks, and interactive voxel modification. This enhancement will transform it from a terrain viewer into a complete game development platform while maintaining its performance characteristics, modular architecture, and existing Three.js foundation.
