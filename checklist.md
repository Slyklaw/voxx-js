### Voxel Engine Development Checklist

#### Stage 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize project structure - single index.html file with inline css and js
- [ ] Set up build tools (if needed)
- [ ] Import necessary libraries (Three.js, etc.)

#### Stage 2: Basic Rendering
- [ ] Create a 3D scene
- [ ] Render a single block
- [ ] Render a grid of blocks

#### Stage 3: Player Controls
- [ ] Add first-person camera movement
- [ ] Handle mouse look
- [ ] Implement WASD movement

#### Stage 4: Block Interaction
- [ ] Add block selection (raycasting)
- [ ] Implement block placement
- [ ] Implement block destruction

#### Stage 5: World Management
- [ ] Implement chunking system
- [ ] Generate terrain procedurally
- [ ] Optimize rendering with frustum culling

#### Stage 6: Visual Enhancements
- [ ] Add textures to blocks
- [ ] Implement basic lighting
- [ ] Add skybox and fog

#### Stage 7: Additional Features
- [ ] Add day/night cycle
- [ ] Implement simple physics (falling blocks)
- [ ] Add multiplayer support

Each stage builds upon the previous one. Start with the core functionality and add features incrementally. This checklist provides a structured approach to developing a 3D voxel engine similar to Minecraft.
