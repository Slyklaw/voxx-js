# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Minecraft-inspired voxel-based 3D world using Three.js. The clone will provide core Minecraft gameplay mechanics including world generation, block placement/destruction, player movement, and basic crafting. The game will run in a web browser and provide an immersive 3D experience similar to the original Minecraft.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to navigate a 3D voxel world, so that I can explore and interact with the environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL render a 3D world with voxel-based terrain
2. WHEN the player uses WASD keys THEN the system SHALL move the player character in the corresponding directions
3. WHEN the player moves the mouse THEN the system SHALL rotate the camera view accordingly
4. WHEN the player presses the spacebar THEN the system SHALL make the player character jump
5. IF the player attempts to move through solid blocks THEN the system SHALL prevent the movement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to break and place blocks, so that I can modify the world to my liking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player left-clicks on a block THEN the system SHALL remove that block from the world
2. WHEN the player right-clicks while holding a block THEN the system SHALL place that block at the targeted location
3. WHEN a block is broken THEN the system SHALL add it to the player's inventory
4. IF the player attempts to place a block in an occupied space THEN the system SHALL prevent the placement
5. WHEN blocks are modified THEN the system SHALL update the visual representation immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see different types of blocks and terrain, so that the world feels diverse and interesting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the world generates THEN the system SHALL create terrain with grass, dirt, stone, and other block types
2. WHEN terrain generates THEN the system SHALL create realistic height variations and landscapes
3. WHEN blocks are rendered THEN the system SHALL display appropriate textures for each block type
4. WHEN the player explores THEN the system SHALL generate new terrain chunks as needed
5. IF the player moves far from spawn THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent world generation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to manage my inventory and craft items, so that I can create tools and building materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses 'E' THEN the system SHALL open the inventory interface
2. WHEN the player collects blocks THEN the system SHALL add them to the inventory with proper stacking
3. WHEN the player accesses crafting THEN the system SHALL display available recipes based on inventory
4. WHEN the player crafts an item THEN the system SHALL consume required materials and create the new item
5. IF the inventory is full THEN the system SHALL prevent additional item collection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run smoothly in my browser, so that I can enjoy uninterrupted gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game runs THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 30 FPS during normal gameplay
2. WHEN rendering the world THEN the system SHALL optimize performance by culling non-visible blocks
3. WHEN loading new terrain THEN the system SHALL do so without causing frame drops
4. WHEN the player moves quickly THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth camera movement
5. IF the browser has limited resources THEN the system SHALL adjust rendering quality accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to save and load my world, so that I can continue my progress across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player makes world changes THEN the system SHALL automatically save the world state
2. WHEN the player returns to the game THEN the system SHALL load the previously saved world
3. WHEN saving occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all block modifications and player position
4. WHEN loading fails THEN the system SHALL generate a new world and notify the player
5. IF the save data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
