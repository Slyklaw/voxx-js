An outline of our tasks is specified in checklist.md. Proceed through the checklist item by item. When an item is completed, mark off the entry in the checklist. We're on Windows OS, so use the command "start index.html" to test the application.

Restrict camera movement to the horizonal plane. Restriction camera movement to disallow tilting side to side, but do allow looking up or down.
