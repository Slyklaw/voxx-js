# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements vertex-based ambient occlusion for the voxel world to enhance visual depth and realism. The ambient occlusion system will analyze neighboring voxels around each face vertex to determine appropriate shadowing, creating more realistic lighting that makes voxel structures appear more three-dimensional and visually appealing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Ambient Occlusion Calculation System

**User Story:** As a player, I want voxel faces to have realistic shadowing based on neighboring blocks, so that the world appears more three-dimensional and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a voxel face is generated THEN the system SHALL calculate ambient occlusion values for each vertex of that face
2. WHEN calculating ambient occlusion for a vertex THEN the system SHALL examine the 3 adjacent neighboring voxels around that vertex
3. WHEN a neighboring voxel is solid THEN the system SHALL apply shadow contribution to that vertex
4. WHEN a neighboring voxel is air THEN the system SHALL apply light contribution to that vertex
5. WHEN all required neighbor checks are complete THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate vertex colors (light or shadow)

### Requirement 2: Mesh Generation Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ambient occlusion system to integrate seamlessly with the existing greedy meshing algorithm, so that performance is maintained while adding visual enhancement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating chunk meshes THEN the system SHALL extend the existing greedy meshing to include vertex color attributes
2. WHEN creating face geometry THEN the system SHALL calculate and assign ambient occlusion colors to each vertex
3. WHEN merging faces in greedy meshing THEN the system SHALL preserve vertex color information correctly
4. WHEN a face spans multiple voxels THEN the system SHALL interpolate ambient occlusion values appropriately
5. WHEN mesh generation is complete THEN the system SHALL produce geometry with both position and color attributes

### Requirement 3: Diagonal Triangulation Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want voxel faces to be triangulated optimally to avoid visual artifacts, so that ambient occlusion appears smooth and natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN triangulating a quad face THEN the system SHALL choose the diagonal that minimizes lighting artifacts
2. WHEN vertex ambient occlusion values are calculated THEN the system SHALL compare diagonal sums to determine optimal triangulation
3. WHEN the sum of opposite corners differs significantly THEN the system SHALL choose the diagonal with better lighting distribution
4. WHEN triangulation is determined THEN the system SHALL generate indices that respect the chosen diagonal orientation
5. WHEN faces are rendered THEN the system SHALL display smooth ambient occlusion without visible triangulation artifacts

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want the ambient occlusion system to run efficiently without impacting game performance, so that I can enjoy enhanced visuals without frame rate drops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating ambient occlusion THEN the system SHALL cache neighbor lookups to avoid redundant calculations
2. WHEN processing large chunks THEN the system SHALL complete ambient occlusion calculations within acceptable time limits
3. WHEN multiple chunks are being generated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame rates
4. WHEN voxels are modified THEN the system SHALL only recalculate ambient occlusion for affected faces
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN memory usage SHALL remain within reasonable bounds

### Requirement 5: Visual Quality Control

**User Story:** As a player, I want ambient occlusion to enhance the visual quality of the voxel world, so that structures and terrain appear more realistic and immersive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ambient occlusion is applied THEN shadow areas SHALL be visibly darker than lit areas
2. WHEN viewing voxel structures THEN depth and dimensionality SHALL be clearly enhanced
3. WHEN light and shadow meet THEN transitions SHALL appear smooth and natural
4. WHEN different block types are adjacent THEN ambient occlusion SHALL work consistently across all block types
5. WHEN the system is active THEN overall visual quality SHALL be noticeably improved compared to flat lighting

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ambient occlusion system to work harmoniously with existing lighting and rendering systems, so that all visual effects complement each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ambient occlusion is active THEN it SHALL work alongside existing directional and ambient lighting
2. WHEN the sun system changes lighting conditions THEN ambient occlusion SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN shadows are cast by the sun THEN ambient occlusion SHALL complement rather than conflict with shadow mapping
4. WHEN vertex colors are applied THEN they SHALL blend properly with material textures if present
5. WHEN rendering the scene THEN ambient occlusion SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing Three.js material system
